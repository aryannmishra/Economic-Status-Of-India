This project aims to analyze and predict the economic status of different states in India using machine learning models. By leveraging socio-economic indicators such as literacy rates, employment levels, GDP per capita, infrastructure indices, and other relevant features, we provide insights and visualizations to understand regional disparities and forecast economic trends.

📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to:

Study the economic development patterns across Indian states.

Build predictive models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting) to estimate economic performance.

Visualize the economic disparities using interactive heat maps and graphs.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data analysis & machine learning

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook

GeoPandas & Folium (for geographic heatmaps)

🧠 Machine Learning Models
Linear Regression: To establish a baseline model

Gradient Boosting Regressor: For better prediction performance and feature importance analysis

Evaluation using R² Score, MAE, RMSE

📍 Data Sources
Government of India Open Data Portal

Census of India

Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)

World Bank & UN datasets (where applicable)

📈 Visualizations
State-wise heatmaps showing GDP, poverty rate, literacy, etc.

Correlation heatmaps between economic indicators

Model performance comparison graphs
