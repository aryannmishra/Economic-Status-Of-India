This project aims to **analyze and predict the economic status** of various Indian states using machine learning techniques. By leveraging socio-economic indicators such as **literacy rates**, **employment levels**, **GDP per capita**, and **infrastructure indices**, we provide insights and interactive visualizations to understand regional disparities and forecast future trends.
